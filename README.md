First, you should assign the length of the tracks in the "Pattern length" section (the length is measured in characters)
Then, if you wish, you can change the Delay section - the delay between characters (milliseconds * 100)
|
After that, ALWAYS press the "Set" button to implement the values in the container

The "Randomize" button automatically creates an array of characters on each track
